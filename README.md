## Punchcarder
One of my first OOP projects in python, this program could be used like a punchcard machine, keeping track of when users entered and exited. It stores information about users and their times in JSONs which it will automatically create. To get started, the Admin username is "admin" and password is "admin". 

## Euchre
My attempt at creating a Euchre simulator. Unfinished as of yet, but should be able to act like an app one could play Euchre on, but through a text interface.
