    Following the instructions in the handout, construct the private key
    components of the MH Cryptosystem. This consists of 3 tasks:

    1. Build a superincreasing sequence `w` of length n
        Note: You can double-check that a sequence is superincreasing by using:
            `utils.is_superincreasing(seq)`
    2. Choose some integer `q` greater than the sum of all elements in `w`
    3. Discover an integer `r` between 2 and q that is coprime to `q`
        Note: You can use `utils.coprime(r, q)` for this.

    You'll also need to use the random module's `randint` function, which you
    will have to import.

    Somehow, you'll have to return all three of these values from this function!
    Can we do that in Python?!

    :param n: Bitsize of message to send (defaults to 8)
    :type n: int

    :returns: 3-tuple private key `(w, q, r)`, with `w` a n-tuple, and q and r ints.

def encrypt_mh(message, public_key):

    Following the outline of the handout, you will need to:
    1. Separate the message into chunks based on the size of the public key.
        In our case, that's the fixed value n = 8, corresponding to a single
        byte. In principle, we should work for any value of n, but we'll
        assert that it's fine to operate byte-by-byte.
    2. For each byte, determine its 8 bits (the `a_i`s). You can use
        `utils.byte_to_bits(byte)`.
    3. Encrypt the 8 message bits by computing
         c = sum of a_i * b_i for i = 1 to n
    4. Return a list of the encrypted ciphertexts for each chunk of the message.

    Hint: Think about using `zip` and other tools we've discussed in class.

    :type message: bytes

        algorithm (implemented for you at `utils.modinv(r, q)`)

         c' = cs (mod q)

        the original plaintext byte.
